### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Task` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `ObservableList` object) that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other four components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, task list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* `JsonAdaptedTaskTag` and `JsonAdaptedPersonTag` are actually the non-ambiguious direct representation of `JsonAdaptedTag`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Supplier feature

#### Implementation

The functionality to edit a supplier's details is contained within the `EditCommand` class, which extends the abstract `Command` class by operating on a given `Model` in the following summarised way:

A `Person` in the given `Model` is selected using an index number, following which a new `Person` object with user-specified details is created. 
Finally, the old `Person` is replaced with the new `Person` after validity checks have succeeded.

To achieve the aforementioned, the `EditCommand` class encapsulates the nested class `EditPersonDescriptor`, which serves to hold the user's input details that will subsequently be used to update the chosen `Person`. 
`EditPersonDescriptor` implements:

- `isAnyFieldEdited()` â€” Checks if any of the fields to be updated is non-empty.
- Getters and setters to access and modify the corresponding fields of the given `EditPersonDescriptor` object.

![EditCommandObjectDiagram](images/EditCommandObjectDiagram.png)

The respective `Parser` subclass, in this case `EditCommandParser`, is called by a chain of method calls starting when the program is launched.

#### Rationale for implementation

As per the initial implementation of AB3, two `Person` objects cannot have the same name. For our real life scenario, it is irregular for two suppliers to have different names but the same phone number.
As a result, `Person#isSamePerson(Person otherPerson)` has been modified to check for either the same `name` OR the same `phone`.

The mechanism of `EditCommand` meant that when an edit command is executed, the `editedPerson` with newly edited attributes would be compared in equality to the initial `personToEdit` it was supposed to edit, or effectively "replace".

This led to some bugs, for instance in the scenario that the `editedPerson` differed from the initial `personToEdit` by only either `name` OR `phone`, these two `Person` objects would be compared and fail the original implementation of `Person#isSamePerson(Person otherPerson)` because
of the other similar field (`phone` or `name` respectively), every time.

This called for a new method, `Model#hasPersonExcluding(Person person, Person excludedPerson)`, which effectively ignores the initial `personToEdit` when comparing all existing `Person` objects for equal `name` or `phone` attributes.

#### Execution of the edit command

The arguments provided to this function call, which specify the details to edit the target `Person` with, are each prefixed by various prefixes (such as `n/` for `Name`, `i/` for `Item`) 
to allow the `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` to recognise and split the provided arguments into the correct categories for easier parsing and updating.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit supplier command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ReadOnlyAddressBook` that holds supplier data in the application is initialised with supplier data stored on the `AddressBookStorage` saved on disk, otherwise it is populated with sample supplier data from `SampleDataUtil`.
<img src="images/PersonStorageDataExistsState.png" width="350" />
<img src="images/PersonStorageDataNotExistState.png" width="350" />

Step 2. The user executes `edit 2 n/New Supplier Name p/61234567 i/Cookies` to edit the 2nd person in the supplier list to have the new name of "New Supplier Name", the new phone number of "61234567" and the new item supplied of "Cookies".
Then, multiple processes occur to parse, validate and execute the command.
- `EditCommandParser` parses this command in multiple steps. First, `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` creates an `ArgumentMultimap` from the given arguments and respective prefixes. This allows the `Index` of the chosen supplier, and the input details for each field to be extracted.
If the provided `Index` is invalid, a `ParseException` is thrown. Otherwise, for each existing valid prefix in the `ArgumentMultimap`, an `EditPersonDescriptor` is built with the input values corresponding to the prefixes.
The existing prefixes are `n/`, `p/` and `i/`, and values are "New Supplier Name", "61234567" and "Cookies" respectively. A new `EditCommand` is constructed with the given `Index` and `EditPersonDescriptor`.
![EditCommandParserSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png)
- At this point, there are multiple checks for validity of the `Index` and `EditPersonDescriptor` arguments. Notably, the edited `Person`, who is to replace the old `Person`, has to be unique from the other existing `Person`s within the address book.
`Model#hasPersonExcluding(Person person, Person excludedPerson)` facilitates this by first excluding the `Person` to be edited from the duplicate checks, then calling `Person#isSamePerson(Person otherPerson)` to compare the edited `Person` with all other `Person`s.
Again, this checks if the two `Person` objects have the same `Name` or `Phone` attributes.
![EditCommandVerifyActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandVerifyActivityDiagram.png)

- If all checks pass, `Model#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` is called to replace the old `Person` with the edited `Person` within the `ObservableList<Person>`, which is encapsulated within the `UniquePersonList` class and serves to ensure uniqueness of all of its `Person` contents.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes an edit supplier command.
![EditCommandSummaryActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandSummaryActivityDiagram.png)

#### Proposed enhancements/changes

Subsequently, the `SupplyItem` class which encapsulates an item in a vendor's inventory will be implemented. Each instance of this class contains a reference to a `Person` (i.e. each item in the inventory is supplied by one supplier). 
As a result, editing a supplier's details necessitate a corresponding update to the `SupplyItem` object that has a reference to the edited `Person`.

<img src="images/SupplierAndSupplyItemClassDiagram.png" width="300" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
